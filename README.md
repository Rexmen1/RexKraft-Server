# RexKraft Server - Public Repository 🏰

Welcome to the official open-source repository for **RexKraft**!

This repository hosts the configuration files, scripts, and public resources used to run the RexKraft Minecraft server. We believe in transparency and community collaboration—this is your chance to help us improve the server!

## ⚠️ Security & Missing Files

**Please Note:**
For security reasons, this repository does **not** contain every single file found on the actual server.

* **Excluded:** Passwords, database credentials, `server.properties`, premium plugin binaries (`.jar` files), and player data.
* **Included:** Plugin configurations, messages.yml files, custom scripts, and public resource packs.

This ensures the server remains secure while still allowing you to view and edit the gameplay logic and text.
